## Our e-commerce database
In Level 1, you'll learn the basics of data retrieval.  
To retrieve data, we need to have tables with information.

In this level, we'll be working with e-commerce data, which should be interesting!

Let's take the example of an e-commerce company like Amazon.  
What kind of data do they require?

Since e-commerce is all about selling products,  
they need data related to the products they sell, like the product name, price, and description.

Additionally, they need data on their users or customers who use their e-commerce platform, such as their name, email, address.

Reviews are also an important type of data.  
Ratings and feedback left by customers who have purchased a product are useful for e-commerce platforms like Amazon to improve their offerings and enhance customer satisfaction.

Another important type of data for e-commerce platforms is vendor data. Having information on the vendors that supply the products is crucial for managing inventory, ensuring timely delivery, and tracking supplier performance.

## Retrieving all column data by using the SELECT statement
In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. The asterisk symbol (*) is used to select all columns of a table.

Here's an example of a basic SELECT statement with an asterisk:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
 ```
1. SELECT: Indicates that we want to retrieve data from the table.  
2. * : The asterisk symbol (*) is used to select all columns of a table.  
3. FROM: Specifies the name of the table we want to retrieve data from.

Example: Suppose we have a database table named "Customers" with columns "CustomerID", "FirstName", "LastName", and "Email". To retrieve all the data from this table using a SELECT statement with an asterisk, we would use the following SQL code:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customers;
 ```

This statement will select all the columns from the "Customers" table and display them in the result set. The result set will contain all rows from the table.

## Retrieving specific column data by using the SELECT statement
In the previous lesson, we learned about retrieving all the data from a table using SELECT, FROM, and the Asterisk(*) symbol. However, sometimes we only want to see certain columns of a table, not all of them.

For example, imagine a table of customers for an e-commerce website. This table might have columns like name, email, password. If we only want to see the name and email columns, we can use the SELECT statement followed by the specific column names we want to retrieve, separated by commas.

Here's an example query:

 ```sql
SELECT name, email 
FROM customers;
```

This query will only retrieve the name and email columns from the customers table, and not the other columns like password. This can be useful if we want to focus on specific information in a table and not get overwhelmed with unnecessary data.
