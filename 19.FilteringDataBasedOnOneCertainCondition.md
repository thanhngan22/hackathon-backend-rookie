# ğŸ§© Filtering Data Based on One Certain Condition
## Utilizing the WHERE clause
Imagine you have a huge pile of products in a warehouse, and you want to find a specific product among them. It would be a tedious task to go through each product one by one until you find the one you are looking for.

Now, let's say you have a magical tool that can help you narrow down your search by only showing you the products that meet specific criteria, such as the product's brand, color, price range, or availability. This tool is similar to the WHERE clause in SQL, which allows you to filter the data based on specific conditions.

In the context of e-commerce, the WHERE clause can be used to retrieve specific products from the Products table that match certain criteria. For example, you can use the WHERE clause to retrieve all the products that are priced equal to $799.99.

Here's an example SQL statement that uses the WHERE clause to retrieve the product information based on these conditions:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE price = 799.99;
 ```

In this example, the WHERE clause filters the data from the Products table based on a condition: the price. The result of this query will be a list of products that meet these criteria, making it much easier to find what you are looking for among a large number of products.

## Comparing greater than or less than
The greater than and less than operators are used to compare numeric or date/time values in SQL.

The greater than operator is represented by the symbol ">" and is used to retrieve data where a specific column value is greater than a given value.

For example, if you want to retrieve all products with a price greater than $50, you would use the greater than operator in the WHERE clause like this:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM products 
WHERE price > 50;
 ```

The less than operator is represented by the symbol "<" and is used to retrieve data where a specific column value is less than a given value.

For example, if you want to retrieve all products with a price less than $100, you would use the less than operator in the WHERE clause like this:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM products 
WHERE price < 50;
 ```

In each of these examples, the greater than or less than operator is used to filter the data based on a specific condition. The SQL statement retrieves only the rows that meet the condition specified by the operator.
