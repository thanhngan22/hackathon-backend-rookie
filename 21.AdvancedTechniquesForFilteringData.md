# ðŸ§© Advanced Techniques for Filtering Data
## 1. Using the IN operator
When you want to retrieve data that satisfies multiple conditions,
you can use several OR operators.
 
Don't you think it can be quite complicated? 
Because to select data that satisfies 10 conditions,
you have to use 10 OR operators. 

In this case, we use IN Operator 
The IN operator is used to select data with multiple values.

Previously, you used multiple OR operators to select data
that matches the multiple values. 
 
Itâ€™s called the â€˜Multiple OR Operationâ€™.

Look at the query related to â€˜Multiple OR Operationâ€™ learned earlier.
 
1. This is the WHERE statement for data selection.
2. To select data that matches three values of 'value1', 'value2', and 'value3' in the 'column1' column,
3. Place three comparison operator statements.
4. After that, combine three comparison operator statements with the OR operator.

Since there is the IN operator that performs the same function,
the multiple OR operation syntax is not commonly used. 

IN operator uses the following syntax.
 
1. Use the WHERE statement for filtering data.
2. After the WHERE keyword, specify the column that is the selection criteria.
3. Next, place the IN keyword.
4. After the IN keyword, place brackets to deliver multiple values.
5. specify several values separated by â€˜,â€™ inside the brackets.

Using the IN operator lets you achieve the same result
as the multiple OR operator in a much simpler way.

## 2. Using the BETWEEN operator
There may be times when you want to select data within a specific range, right. 

For example, selecting customer data for those in their 20s,
that is, between 20 and 29 years old. 
 
To achieve this, you can use two AND operators
and two comparison operators (>=, <=). 
 
Is there a simpler way to do this? 
 
The BETWEEN operator can be the solution. 

The BETWEEN operator is used to select data that satisfies a specific range condition.

The BETWEEN operator can be used for sequential data
such as Number, Date, and String.

By inputting two values, value1 and value2, you can select data
that falls within the range of value1 and value2, inclusive.

The BETWEEN operator uses the following Syntax.
 
1. Use the WHERE statement for filtering data.
2. After the WHERE keyword, specify the column that is the selection criteria.
3. Next, place the BETWEEN keyword. 
4. After that, specify the starting and ending values of the range condition, value1 and value2.
5. Combine two values of range condition using the AND keyword.

## 3. Matching the Beginning of a String
When retrieving for customer data,
you may need to look it up by the customerâ€™s name. 
 
But what if you only know a part of the customer's name,
such as the last name? 
 
In this case, we use LIKE operator. 

The LIKE operator is used to select string data with a specific pattern.

Previously, you used the = operator
to select data that exactly matches a string value.

On the other hand, when using the LIKE operator with a pattern,
you can select data that partially matches the string value.

In brief, the = operator is a condition 
that data matches exactly a string value,

while the LIKE operator is a condition 
that data partially matches a string value.

he LIKE operator uses the following syntax.
 
1. Use the WHERE statement for filtering data.
2. After the WHERE keyword, specify the column that is the selection criteria.
3. Next, place the LIKE keyword. 
4. After the LIKE keyword, specify a pattern condition.

The LIKE operator is used to select string data with a specific pattern.   
There is a special symbol used when defining a pattern, and it is the Wildcard.

The % symbol is a typical case of Wildcard.   
The % symbol is used when defining the pattern
that any string is permitted at a specific position in the string.

Let's learn about the four typical patterns that can be defined using the % Wildcard.
 

01. The first pattern is about placing the % after a string.   
This pattern is used to select data that starts with a specific string.

## 4. Matching the End of a String
The second pattern is about placing the % before a string.   
This pattern is used to select data that ends with a specific string.

## 5. Matching Any Position of a String
03. The third pattern is about placing the % before and after a string.   
This pattern is used to select data with a specific string.

## 6. Matching the Beginning and the End of a String
The fourth pattern is about placing the % between strings.   
This pattern is used to select data that
starts with a specific string and ends with the other specific string.

## 7. Using SELECT DISTINCT Statement on Multiple Columns
Have you ever had an experience where you wanted
to remove duplicates from the data you retrieved? 
 
Let's say you want to extract unique genres of movies
that a customer has watched. 
 
To do this, we need to retrieve the list of movies
that the customer has watched,
and remove duplicate genres from that list. 
 
In this case, we use DISTINCT statement

The DISTINCT statement is used with the SELECT statement
to remove duplicate data from the retrieved result.

The DISTINCT statement receives one or multiple columns. 

If one column is specified,
it removes duplicate data based on that column.

If multiple columns are specified,
it removes duplicate data based on the combination of their values.

The DISTINCT statement uses the following syntax.
 
1. Since duplicates are removed from the retrieved results, it is used with the SELECT statement.
2. After the SELECT keyword, place the DISTINCT keyword.
3. Specify the columns that serve as the criteria for removing duplicates.

## 8. Selecting the Null Value Data by Using the IS NULL operator
To insert data into a database, a collection process is required.     
 
However,     
data can often be missing or unavailable during this process.     
 
Missing data typically occurs due to human error     
or system failures.

A situation where data collection is unavailable could be     
when trying to collect TOEIC test scores for students     
who did not take the test.

In this case, we use Null Value

The topic you will learn about is the Null Value.     
 
Null Value implies a state where a specific value is not specified.     
 
In programming, the state of not having a value specified implies the state of having a space assigned for specifying the value.
 
The assigned space is not empty     
because it was previously used by someone else.     
 
Instead, it contains an unknown value.

Because the Null Value is the state of storing the unknown value,      
an unintended result like Null or Unknown may occur     
when using general operators.

That is why careful attention is needed when dealing with the Null Value.     
 
It is appropriate to use after processing with the operator for the Null Value.      

Null Values can cause various issues in dealing with data.   
 
When calculating the average TOEIC score of a class,   
what should be done about students who did not take the test?   
In other words, how should we handle Null Values?   
Perhaps the untested students would be excluded   
from the calculation of the average,   
or their scores would be treated as 0.   
 
To do this, we need a way to select Null Values.   
 
In this case, we use IS NULL operator.   

The IS NULL operator can select Null Value data   
with the WHERE statement.   

Since the Null Value cannot be specified,   
when using the = operator, it returns UNKNOWN.   
 
And you cannot select data that matches the Null Value.   
 
Therefore, you need an operator like IS NULL   
that can select Null Value data.   

The IS NULL operator selects data using the status, not the value.   
 
In other words, it checks whether data has been specified or not   
and selects NULL Value data.   

The IS NULL operator uses the following syntax.
 
1. Use the WHERE statement for filtering data.   
2. After the WHERE keyword, specify the column that is the selection criteria.   
3. Next, place the IS NULL keyword.

## 9. Filtering the Null Value Data by Using the IS NOT NULL operator
Null Values can cause various issues in dealing with data. 
 
When calculating the average TOEIC score of a class, 
what should be done about students who did not take the test? 
In other words, how should we handle Null Values? 
Excluding untested students from the average calculation 
can be a good approach. 
 
To do this, we need a way to select data without Null Values. 
 
In this case, we use IS NOT NULL operator. 

The IS NOT NULL statement can select data without Null Value, 
in contrast to the IS NULL statement. 

Since the Null Value cannot be specified, 
when using the != operator, it returns UNKNOWN. 
 
And you cannot select data that without the Null Value. 

Therefore, an operator like IS NOT NULL is necessary 
to select data without the Null Value. 
 
IS NOT NULL operator selects data using the status, not the value. 
 
In other words, it checks whether data has been specified or not 
and selects data without the NULL Value. 
 
The IS NOT NULL operator uses the following syntax.
 
1. Use the WHERE statement for filtering data. 
2. After the WHERE keyword, specify the column that is the selection criteria. 
3. Next, place the IS NOT NULL keyword.
